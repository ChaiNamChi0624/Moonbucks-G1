Dubai’s commercial transport sector sees ‘significant growth’ during first quarter of 2022

The commercial transport sector in Dubai has seen “significant growth” of 37 percent during the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period of last year.

The figures from the Road & Transport Authority (RTA) reflect the strength of the business movement in the commercial transport sector, the government-backed news agency, Wam, reported. 

The sector plays a vital and prominent role by helping with the movement of people and goods, and positively affecting the advancement of economic development in Dubai.

The Director of Commercial Transport Activities, Licensing Agency, RTA, Mansour Al Sabahi, said: “This 37 percent growth rate clearly reflects the recovery of the commercial transport activities across the emirate during the first quarter of 2022.”

The car rental business accounted for the largest number of new firms, and reflected an increase of 14 percent. “This increase is indicative of the overall economic recovery in the emirate,” he added.

The authority “constantly seeks to consolidate and strengthen relations with companies operating in the commercial transport sector to address all the challenges they face in the course of their daily work,” reported WAM. 

RTA’s Commercial Transport Activities Department has been making sustained efforts to meet the needs of the sector by holding joint gatherings with stakeholders to enhance business relationships and develop the best solutions to the problems they encounter.

The authority saw the registration of 800 new companies in the field of transport and car rental in 2022, resulting in the registration of about 25,000 new vehicles.
